# General PHP Principles
- Always start files with `declare(strict_types=1);`.
- PHP 8.3+ features must be leveraged (readonly, typed properties, enums, etc.).
- Follow PSR-12 strictly.
- Prioritize clarity, type safety, and predictability over cleverness or shortcuts.
- Avoid magic methods (`__get`, `__set`, `__call`) unless absolutely necessary.

# Typing
- All methods, functions, and properties must be fully typed.
- Use `void` or `never` return types where appropriate.
- Always prefer explicit type declarations over inferred types.

# OOP Practices
- Classes must be `final` unless proven otherwise necessary.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use dependency injection rather than static access (`new Something()` inside methods is discouraged).
- Use named constructors for complex object creation.

# Comments and Docblocks
- Avoid comments that explain "what".
  Express code meaning through naming and structure.
- Use docblocks only for:
  - Revealing array contents (`@var list<string>`)
  - Describing complex structures (generics, traversables)
  - Explaining *why* something is done.
- Use fully qualified class names in docblocks.

# String Handling
- Prefer string interpolation with `{}` braces over concatenation.
- Use `sprintf` when formatting multiple variables.

# Error Handling
- Always throw typed, domain-specific exceptions.
- Avoid generic `Exception` wherever possible.
- Differentiate between programmer errors (assertions) and user input errors (exceptions).

# Dependency Management
- Use Composer. Lock dependencies via `composer.lock`.
- Keep `composer.json` normalized and audited.
- Add `composer audit` to CI pipelines.

# Performance
- Typecast using native casting, not functions:
  ```php
  $id = (int) $id; // GOOD
  ```
- Prefer `isset()` and `array_key_exists()` checks for large arrays.
- Optimize production servers with `opcache`.

# Enums
- Always use PHP 8.1+ native `enum` for fixed value sets.
- Use PascalCase for enum cases.

# Regular Expressions
- Prioritize regex readability and performance.
- Use named capture groups and reuse patterns properly.

# Security
- Always validate and sanitize external input.
- Prevent SQL injection by whitelisting columns.
- Escape or purify user-supplied HTML before rendering.
